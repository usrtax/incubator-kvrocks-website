Although it works well in most scenes since the capacity of Kvrocks was far larger than Redis, it\u2019s still trivial to scale-out in-flight, so we decided to implement the cluster mode to make it easier.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Design/design-structure-on-rocksdb":{"id":"Design/design-structure-on-rocksdb","title":"Design Complex Structure On Rocksdb","description":"kvrocks uses the rocksdb as storage, it\'s developed by Facebook which is built on LevelDB with many extra features, like column family, transaction and backup, see the rocksdb wiki: Features Not In LevelDB. The basic operations in rocksdb are Put(key, value), Get(key), Delete(key), other complex structures aren\'t supported. The main goal of this doc is to explain how we built the Redis hash/list/set/zset/bitmap on rocksdb. Most of the design were derived from Qihoo360 Blackwidow, but with little modification, like the bitmap design, it\'s a really interesting part.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Design/replication":{"id":"Design/replication","title":"Replication of rocksdb data","description":"A instance is turned into a slave role when SLAVEOF cmd is received.
